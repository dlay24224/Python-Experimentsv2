# Python-Experimentsv2
# My GitHub Journey

This repository contains a picture of *Jeni's Ice Cream*, which I find delicious. It will soon contain the initial code I create while learning to use GitHub as part of DSCI 8133, *Foundations of Data Science* at Mississippi State University.

## Plan

Future plans for this repository include more ice cream pictures, sample data files, and a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org) to analyze the data.

## About Me

My name is Tyler Layton, and I'm pursuing a career in Data Science, **a field that is both exciting and rewarding**.

- Eager to learn
- Problem solver
- Strong research skills

I chose the ice cream photo because it's the least generic image I had. I hope you enjoy it!
